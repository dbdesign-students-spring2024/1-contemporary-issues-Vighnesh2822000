# The MTA's use of Artificial Intelligence in Subway station cameras
While seeing a growing number of cameras on the subway system, i was curious of finding out abou this. This lead me to the news of the MTA using new softwares with the video data they gather to curb fare evasion. In this document I discuss two articles on this matter and their arguments to this development.


## Article 1 
[NYC subway using AI to track fare evasion](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/nyc-subway-using-ai-track-fare-evasion-rcna93045) In NBC's article on this matter the focus seems to be on the downside of increasing surveillance within the city. They bat for the privacy side of things. ALthough the MTA spolesperson has said that the data collected from these softwares is not passed on to NYPD to help in arrest or charges, privacy groups are worried by the direction the authorities are moving forward with. Instead of trying to make travel affordable, policies are made to punish the poorest of the city, according to the article. 


## Article 2
[The NYC subway is using automated scanning software to spot fare evaders](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23802912/mta-nyc-subway-ai-scanning-software-fare-evasion) Whereas in the article published by 'The Verge' the focus seems to be mainly on the justification for the need for such system given the losses that the MTA has suffered due to fare evasion. Ther is information about the other plans the MTA has in ints pipeline such as installing glass doors instead of excisting turnstiles. It also talks about the effectiveness of the prelimanry study that has helped in identifying a window of time where evasion happens a lot and on which lines. Such data is very crucial to curb evaders.
